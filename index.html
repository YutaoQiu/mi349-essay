    <p>For me, the project of using CSS custom properties is a bit more difficult. Although this part is only a few short lines of code, it covers the logic of the entire HTML page. We generally include a large amount of CSS when making complex web pages and have many repeated values ​​that affect our judgment. In this case, we need to use CSS custom attributes to help sort out the logical sequence. First, we need to understand the basic custom attribute functions and symbols. The first is VAR, which means to replace the regular attribute value with the specified custom attribute name. Through this function, we can turn a fixed value into a variable to reduce errors. Second, because custom attributes belong to a kind of variable, it has inheritance. This means that if no value is set on a given element, it will directly copy the content described above. Finally, we will also use a backup value to protect our web pages, such as avoiding invalid parameter errors. If there are invalid variables in the code, all values ​​will become initial values.</p>
